# TriCount 

## Requirements
At each opening of the file, macros contents must be enabled: in order not to always have to confirmed it, macro preferences can be configured.

## Description
In order to divide equally what we paid for, my flatmates and I used to use TriCount, until we noticed a bug in it: that's how I came up with the idea of trying to implement it on my own.

## Current State
I hope to complete this development by the end of October 2015, so all functionalities are not usable right now...
